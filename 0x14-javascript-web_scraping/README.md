# 0x14 JavaScript - Web Scraping

This repository is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It includes scripts written in JavaScript for Node.js, focusing on web scraping tasks. These scripts demonstrate basic web scraping techniques, API interactions, and asynchronous JavaScript programming.

## Project Overview

The project includes scripts that perform a range of operations, from reading and writing files to making API requests and processing JSON data.

## File Descriptions

- `0-readme.js`: A script that reads and prints the content of a file.
- `1-writeme.js`: A script that writes a string to a file.
- `2-statuscode.js`: A script that displays the status code of a GET request.
- `3-starwars_title.js`: A script that prints the title of a Star Wars movie based on its episode number.
- `4-starwars_count.js`: A script that displays the number of Star Wars movies in which a specific character appears.
- `5-request_store.js`: A script that fetches content from a web page and writes it to a file.
- `6-completed_tasks.js`: A script that computes the number of completed tasks from a JSON API, grouped by user.
- `100-starwars_characters.js`: A script that prints all characters from a specific Star Wars movie.
- `101-starwars_characters.js`: An advanced script that prints all characters from a specific Star Wars movie in the order they appear in the film.

## Technologies

- Scripts written in JavaScript
- Node.js (version 14.x)
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `0x14-javascript-web_scraping` directory.
3. Install Node.js and npm if not already installed.
4. Run the scripts using Node.js. For example:
	node 3-starwars_title.js 1
5. Ensure that any external modules (like `request`) are installed using npm:
	npm install request
