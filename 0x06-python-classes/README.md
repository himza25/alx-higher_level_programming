0. My first square: This task is about creating a simple Square class with no attributes or methods.
1. Square with size: This task introduces a Square class with a private instance attribute 'size'.
2. Size validation: The Square class now validates the size attribute to ensure it's an integer and >= 0.
3. Area of a square: Added a method to the Square class that calculates and returns the area of the square.
4. Access and update private attribute: Added a getter and setter method for the size attribute of the Square class.
5. Printing a square: Added a my_print method to the Square class for printing the square.
6. Coordinates of a square: Added a position attribute and modified the my_print method to account for position.
7. Singly Linked List: Created a Node class and a SinglyLinkedList class to manage a singly linked list with sorted insert.
8. This task involves implementing a Square class in Python with attributes for size and position. The class includes methods for calculating the area and for printing the square using the '#' character.
9. This task implements a Square class that allows comparison of two Square instances based on their areas.
10. This task implements a MagicClass that mimics the given Python bytecode. It can calculate the area and circumference of a circle based on its radius.
