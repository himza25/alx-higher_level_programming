Task 0 : This project includes a Python script that prints all integers of a list.
Task 1 : This project includes a Python script that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
Task 2 : This project includes a Python script that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
Task 3 : This project includes a Python script that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
Task 4 : This script includes a Python function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.
Task 5 : This script includes a Python function that removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.
Task 6 : This script includes a Python function that prints a matrix of integers.
Task 7 : This task is about creating a Python function that adds 2 tuples
Task 8 : This task is about creating a Python function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character
Task 9 : This task is about creating a Python function that finds the biggest integer of a list
Task 10 : This task is about creating a Python function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list
Task 11 : This task is about creating a Python function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list
Task 12 : This task is about completing the source code in order to switch the values of a and b
Task 13 : Contains the `is_palindrome` function which checks if a given singly linked list is a palindrome.
Task 14 : This task involves creating a C function that prints basic info about Python lists. The function, , takes a PyObject list as an argument and prints its size, the amount of space allocated, and the type of each element in the list.
