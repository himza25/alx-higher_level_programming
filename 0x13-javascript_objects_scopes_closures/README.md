# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

This repository is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum, focusing on JavaScript concepts related to objects, scopes, and closures.

## Overview

This directory contains various tasks that illustrate the use of objects, the understanding of scope, and the application of closures in JavaScript. Each task is a step towards mastering JavaScript's powerful features in object-oriented programming and function scopes.

## Tasks

### 0. Rectangle #0
Introduction to creating a Rectangle class in JavaScript.

### 1. Rectangle #1
Expanding on the Rectangle class, adding width and height validation.

### 2. Rectangle #2
Enhancing the Rectangle class with an instance method for printing the rectangle using the character 'X'.

### 3. Rectangle #3
Further development of the Rectangle class to include methods for calculating the area and the perimeter.

### 4. Rectangle #4
Modification of the Rectangle class to include rotation and double methods.

### 5. Square #0
Creating a Square class that inherits from Rectangle with size as the argument.

### 6. Square #1
Extending the Square class by overriding the constructor and the `print()` method from the Rectangle class.

### 7. Occurrences
Function that returns the number of occurrences in a list.

### 8. Esrever
Function to return the reversed version of a list.

### 9. Log me
Function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

### 10. Number conversion
Function that converts a number to base 10.

### 11. Factor index (Advanced)
Implementing a factorial function using recursion.

### 12. Sorted occurrences (Advanced)
Function that counts the occurrences of elements in a list and returns a sorted dictionary.

### 13. Concat files (Advanced)
Script that concatenates 2 files passed as arguments.

## Learning Objectives
